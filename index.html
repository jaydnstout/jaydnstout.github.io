			The Dave Mustard Conspiracy

			<p>
			Since their formation in 1983, Megadeth's Dave Mustaine has become an icon alongside James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, Scott Ian, and other famous heavy metal guitarists.
			</p>
			<p>
			One prominent feature of Mustaine is his rich, vibrant strawberry blonde hair. However, over the years, that color has very noticeably begun to fade to a dull gray.
			</p>
			<p>
			<em>
			Haven't you seen it? Look at these 
			<b>
			very real 
			</b>
			and 
			<b>
			not digitally altered 
			</b>
			photographs
			</em>
			:

			<br>

			<p>
			However, you may be wondering: 
			<em>
			Despite these undeniable photographs, how does he continue to appear with the rich, vibrant hair he once had? 
			</em>
			The answer is simple: 
			<b>
			mustard
			</b>
			.
			</p>
			<p>
			Mustaine has opted to put mustard in his hair to keep up the facade, earning him the nickname 'Dave Mustard' among our fellow conspiracists.
			</p>
			<p>
			In fact, he even keeps a bottle of mustard near him at all times to ensure that his hair does not fade to a dull gray during a public appearance!
			</p>
			<p>

			<img src="dave_mustard_6.png" height=480>
			</img>
			
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<p>
			With this concrete evidence on the table, there is nothing Mustaine can say or do to further deny the truth. His hair has long lost its rich, vibrant strawberry blonde color, and he has attempted to cover it up by putting mustard in it, but our fellow conspiracists know the truth, and we will not allow him to hide from it any longer!
			</p>
			<p>
			The truth is here! Long live the Dave Mustard Conspiracy!
